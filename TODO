* Run integration tests in Safari

# Feature Development
* Remove event listeners, emit unbind to plugins so that can too
* Grammar for nesting elements, shared with sanitizer/commands
* Intersect commands to run formatters

# Known Bugs (which we could write failing tests for)
* Focus should select all content
* Applying the outdent command on a top level list item breaks P mode.
* When inserting lists we remove any SPANs from the inside to fix a Chrome bug,
  but what if the user actually wants a SPAN?
* Possible to paste blockquotes inside of blockquotes
* Chrome: "1|2", ENTER, <select all>, apply list = orphan P
