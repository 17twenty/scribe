# Feature Development
* Remove event listeners, emit unbind to plugins so that can too
* Config for nesting elements
* Transactions for commands and undo manager


# Outstanding Patches
* Chrome and Firefox: Bold command uses B node instead of STRONG
* Chrome: Indenting/outdenting lists for nesting
* Chrome: appends span to LIs with inline styling for `line-height`: http://jsbin.com/OtemujAY/3/edit?html,css,js,output


# Disabled Things Which Should Be Enabled
* `blockquote` command when caret is in a list


# To Investigate
* Buttons do not update the instance they are clicked. You have to start typing.


# Known Bugs
* Chrome: Add BLOCKQUOTE, add list, unapply blockquote = Creates BLOCKQUOTE
  without P.
* Applying the outdent command on a top level list item breaks P mode.
* When inserting lists we remove any SPANs from the inside to fix a Chrome bug,
  but what if the user actually wants a SPAN?


# Fixed
* Chrome: Add H1, <enter> = Creates DIV
* Chrome: Add empty LI, <enter> = Creates DIV
* Chrome: Add LI, unapply list = Creates DIV
* Chrome: Add BLOCKQUOTE = Nests BLOCKQUOTE inside of P
* Chrome: Add UL = Nests UL inside of P
* Chrome: Add OL = Nests OL inside of P
* Chrome: Add BLOCKQUOTE, add carriage return, unapply blockquote = broken Ps
  - Breaks when blockquote is unapplied on middle paragraph element.
* Chrome: Add 2 Ps, <select all>, apply blockquote, unapply blockquote = broken Ps
* Chrome: Add BLOCKQUOTE = Has `style` attribute
