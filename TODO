# Feature Development
* Remove event listeners, emit unbind to plugins so that can too

# Outstanding Patches
* Chrome: Add H1, <enter> = Creates DIV
* Chrome: Add 2 Ps, <select all>, apply blockquote, unapply blockquote = broken Ps
* Possible to have B and STRONG
* Adding bold to a H2 does not update toolbar

# To Investigate
* Add H, tranform into UL
