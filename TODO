# Feature Development
* Remove event listeners, emit unbind to plugins so that can too

# Outstanding Patches
* Chrome and Firefox: Bold command uses B node instead of STRONG
* Adding bold to a H2 does not update toolbar
* Chrome: Add a UL/OL, apply blockquote = nested UL/OLs (infinite)
  - User can recover by using backspace.

# To Investigate
* Buttons do not update the instance they are clicked. You have to start typing.

# Known Bugs
* Chrome: Add BLOCKQUOTE, add list, unapply blockquote = Creates BLOCKQUOTE
  without P.
* Chrome: Insert list with at least 2 list items, <select all>, <backspace> =
  Creates two orphan list items
  - This is caused by Selection.placeMarkers adding a redundant text node after
    the inserted end marker.
* Bold is disabled when heading is selected, but not when a heading is the child
  of the range (instead of a container).
