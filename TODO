# Feature Development
* Remove event listeners, emit unbind to plugins so that can too

# Outstanding Patches
* Chrome and Firefox: Bold command uses B node instead of STRONG
* Adding bold to a H2 does not update toolbar
* Chrome: Add a UL/OL, apply blockquote = nested UL/OLs (infinite)
  - User can recover by using backspace.

# To Investigate
* Add H, tranform into UL
* Buttons do not update the instance they are clicked. You have to start typing.

# Fixed
* Chrome: Add H1, <enter> = Creates DIV
* Chrome: Add empty LI, <enter> = Creates DIV
* Chrome: Add LI, unapply list = Creates DIV
* Chrome: Add BLOCKQUOTE = Nests BLOCKQUOTE inside of P
* Chrome: Add UL = Nests UL inside of P
* Chrome: Add OL = Nests OL inside of P
* Chrome: Add BLOCKQUOTE, add carriage return, unapply blockquote = broken Ps
  - Breaks when blockquote is unapplied on middle paragraph element.
* Chrome: Add 2 Ps, <select all>, apply blockquote, unapply blockquote = broken Ps
